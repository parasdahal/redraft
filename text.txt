More from the USA:

The United States is a politically divided country. There have been recent statewide elections that have been won by hundreds of votes. Don't assume that all Americans are politically conservative gun-toting rednecks. In fact, most Americans consider themselves moderate and this country has a more progressive view on soft drugs and gay marriage than some Europeans.
Many laws vary by city and state jurisdictions. Research which states you are visiting while in the USA as laws can change from one state to another (even from one city to another)! States such as Colorado and Washington have recently approved the sale of marijuana, while many states and cities will enact harsh punishments for the possession of a single joint.
On that note, don't assume all Americans are alike. We're a country of over 300 million people spread out over 3,000 miles. There are vast cultural differences between someone from the South, the Midwest, East Coast, West Coast, etc. Also, many Americans identify with their state first (New Yorker, Texan, Californian) before they identify with the country as a whole.
Don't overreact to the crime and safety issues. America is going through the lowest rates of violent crime in over 40 years (http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Jus...). Yes, there are bad areas in every city, but most tourist areas and surrounding neighborhoods are safe for the average traveller.
Race conversation is a taboo. America still has many issues with race (although we're a bit more forthcoming about them than Europeans), and a flat out discussion about race (or religion or politics for that matter) is simply not discussed in mixed company at the dinner table.
Edited to add an additional answer: Americans LOVE their personal space. The double-kiss or triple-kiss hello intimidates us and it surprises most foreigners when we back away in disgust. We only tend to hug family or close friends (and straight male-male hugs are generally frowned upon).
