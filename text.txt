I still very remember the day I got my first box of LEGO bricks. It had a picture of cool LEGO army truck positioned in a sandy battlefeild along with those tiny LEGO army figures. I instantly decide it was the coolest toy ever.
I was fascinated by the possibilties of things I could make. Sure, the instruction manual had very detailed steps for creating the truck on the box, but I never got around to it. Every time I set out to build the truck, my imagination would distract me and I would end up with a something like a fighter jet or a laser gun.
Being able to make any toy I could imagine was something I had never felt. Everything in my surrounding inspired me. I built what I wanted. Or destroyed, just to make something new.
I could play god in my own world of LEGO bricks.
This feeling found a home in my little curious brain and made me realize my passion for making stuff. I have never stopped since.
